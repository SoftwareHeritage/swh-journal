        # Local test
        
        As a pre-requisite, you need a kakfa installation path.
        The following target will take care of this:
        
        ```
        make install
        ```
        
        Then, provided you are in the right virtual environment as described
        in the [swh getting-started](https://docs.softwareheritage.org/devel/developer-setup.html#developer-setup):
        
        ```
        pytest
        ```
        
        or:
        
        ```
        tox
        ```
        
        
        # Running
        
        ## publisher
        
        Command:
        ```
        $ swh-journal --config-file ~/.config/swh/journal/publisher.yml \
                      publisher
        ```
        
        # Auto-completion
        
        To have the completion, add the following in your
        ~/.virtualenvs/swh/bin/postactivate:
        
        ```
        eval "$(_SWH_JOURNAL_COMPLETE=$autocomplete_cmd swh-journal)"
        ```
